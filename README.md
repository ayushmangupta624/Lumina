## Lumina

Traditional textbooks and lectures often fail to engage, adapt, or explain concepts in a way that resonates with diverse learning styles, leaving students overwhelmed and disengaged.   

Many students face difficulties in understanding complex concepts in subjects such as mathematics, science, and computer science.  Even long video lectures often fall short when students face a specific doubt since theyâ€™re too broad, too slow, or lack focus. Todayâ€™s students, shaped by short-form content, crave short, engaging, and visually rich content. What better way to reinforce tough academic concepts than with personalized, bite-sized animated explainer videos with voiceovers?

Lumina leverages **Large Language Models** and **advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation** with **semantic search**, **FAISS vector store** and **server-side Manim animation rendering** to **convert an user-uploaded PDF or knowledge base** (for instance, a textbook or lecture notes) and their query about a particular topic to a **highly visual and illustrative animated explainer video with a voiceover** for auditory and visual learning. It also integrates **Web3 (Ethereum)** by using a **Smart Contract to disburse an NFT** upon course completion as a verifiable credential or certificate. 

### Features

- **Quizzes:** Quizzes (Multiple Choice Questions and Long Answers) are automatically generated through RAG to help students test their understanding and immediate memory.
- **Flashcards:** Flashcards are automatically generated through RAG to make memorizing complex subject matter easy. 
- **AI tutor:** Context-aware AI tutor that students can chat with to clarify concepts. 
- **NFT-based courses:** While students can create their own videos on Lumina, pre-curated courses are also offered that users can complete to mint a verifiable credit (like a course certification) in the form of an NFT. This gamifies the learning process and provides an incentive for students to learn more.   
- **Videos with voiceovers:** Unlike other platforms, any animated video generated on Lumina comes with a voiceover to make it truly feel like a lecture.
